"Cook until the water is evaporated and the rice is cooked through, about 15-20 minutes.",1
Season to taste with kosher salt. Keep warm until ready to serve.,1
"Combine the allspice berries and peppercorns in a mortar, or spice grinder, and grind with a pestle until finely ground.",1
Add the remaining ingredients and the ground spices into the base of a food processor. Process until a mostly homogenous mixture forms. Reserve until ready to use.,1
"If necessary, trim off any pieces of fat on the beef. Transfer the meat to the freezer for 30-45 minutes or until firm but not frozen.�",1
"Combine the jerk marinade, soy sauce, and liquid smoke in a large bowl or gallon bag.�",1
Slice the beef across in the grain (for more tender jerky) or with the grain (for chewier jerky) into strips about � inch thick using a large sharp knife of deli slicer.�,1
Add the beef strips to the marinade and fold to combine. Cover the bowl or seal the bag and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to 24 hours.,1
"When ready to cook, set a dehydrator to 160 �F. Remove the pieces of beef from the marinade and pat try using paper towels. Transfer the beef to the dehydrator racks, making sure none of the pieces are overlapping.�",1
"Transfer the racks to the dehydrator and let the strips book for 3 -5 hours. The jerky is ready when it is dry, but still flexible and not cracking.�",1
Make a cut all the way around the circumference on the drumstick about 1 � - 2 inches from the end of the bone. Make sure to slice all the way through the meat and tendon to the bone.,1
"Using a paring knife, scrape the remaining skin and/or meat from the end of the bone. Push the rest of the meat towards the base of the drumstick. Trim the excess tendons with kitchen shears.�",1
Add the Jerk Marinade to a large bowl or gallon bag. Add the chicken to the marinade and fold to combine. Cover the bowl or seal the bag and refrigerate for at least 4 hour or up to 24 hours.,1
"When ready to fry, rinse off the excess marinade and pat the chicken legs dry using paper towels.�",1
"In two shallow dishes preparing the dredging station. Add the beaten eggs to one dish and the flour to the other. Press the marinate chicken legs into the flour, then the egg, and then back into the flour. Try to keep the exposed chicken bone and clean as possible. Set aside while the oil in preheated.",1
"In a large high-wallet skillet or dutch oven, add the lard and vegetable oil. Heat the frying oil mixture over high heat until it reaches 350 �F. Carefully lower the dredged chicken legs into the oil and fry for 5-8 minutes or until golden brown and cooked through (internal temperature of 175 �F).",1
"Transfer the fried chicken legs to a wire rack to rest momentarily. Meanwhile, combine the chopped peppers, sugar, and spices in a medium heat-proof bowl. Carefully, ladle about 1 cup of the still hot fry oil over the contents of the bowl.",1

"Build a small fire in a fire pit and create direct and indirect heat zones. Place a rack over the fire pit and place the sausage over the indirect heat zone. Aim for the temperature to always be between 130�-160�F. If the fire becomes too hot, move the sausage as far away from the heat source as possible. Place a small aluminum pan filled with water next to the sausage. Cover with a large metal bowl and smoke until the internal temperature reaches 165�F, 45 minutes - 1 � hours.�",1

"Mix 160 g of the flour with the sugar, yeast and water until it forms a wet dough. Cover and leave until doubled in size, 1-2 hours.",1
"Add the rest of the flour, the salt and the olive oil. Using a kitchen machine, knead on medium/high speed until smooth and elastic. This usually takes 5-10 minutes, but can vary significantly. Make sure your dough doesnt get hotter than your body temperature  if it does, cover and place in the fridge for 10-15 minutes before continuing. When you can stretch the dough between your fingers until near-transparent before it breaks, its ready. Cover and leave to double in size, around an hour.",1
"Place a pizza stone or baking stone high up in your oven and turn the heat as high as it goes (mine is 300 C). Pizza stones and baking stones need anywhere from 10 minutes to 45 minutes to warm up, depending on the material. If you don't have one, simply preheat the oven to its highest temperature.",1
"When the dough has doubled in size, tip onto a floured surface. Divide into 6-8 equally sized pieces. Shape each piece into a ball by stretching the edges towards the middle repeatedly until you have a firm and smooth surface. Leave the balls to rise a final time, covered and seam-side down, until they have relaxed a little, 15-20 minutes.",1
"Meanwhile, make the topping. Discard the wet core of the tomatoes. Very finely chop the tomatoes, onion, garlic and flat-leaf parsley until completely mixed. I use a kitchen machine for this. If the mixture looks very wet, drain some of the liquid. Add the mixture to a bowl along the minced meat, red pepper paste, tomato paste, salt and pepper.",1
"Roll out each piece of dough to a very thin disc. Place it on a floured pizza peel. You can also place it on a baking parchment, if you find that easier. Using your fingers, add a thin layer of the topping mixture to cover the entire flatbread fairly evenly. Dont worry if there are spots with very little topping. This is normal for lahmacun!",1
"Bake one or two lahmacun at the time until crispy and golden at the edges, 3-8 minutes, depending on your oven heat and whether you are using a pizza stone or baking stone. If you dont have one, bake on a regular baking sheet towards the bottom of the oven for 2-4 minutes. Then move it to the top of the oven to finish off, usually another 2-4 minutes.",1
Serve immediately with your condiments of choice.,1

Yeast: I use Platinum Yeast from Red Star. I have the best results when I use this instant yeast. The Platinum yeast is fantastic because its careful formula strengthens your dough and makes making working with yeast simple. You only need 1 standard packet of yeast (2 and 1/4 teaspoons) to get the job done.,0
"Water: I tested this pizza dough recipe with different amounts of water. 1 and 1/3 cups is the perfect amount. Use warm water to cut down on rise time, about 100-110F. Anything over 130F kills the yeast.",0
"Flour: Use unbleached all-purpose white flour in this recipe. Bleaching the flour strips away some of the protein, which will affect how much water the flour absorbs. You can substitute bread flour for a chewier pizza crust. If you love whole grain bread, try this whole wheat pizza dough instead.",0
"Oil: A couple Tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil adds wonderful flavor to the dough. Dont forget to brush the dough with olive oil before adding the toppings, which prevents the crust from tasting soggy.",0
Salt: Salt adds necessary flavor.,0
"Sugar: 1 Tablespoon of sugar increases the yeasts activity and tenderizes the dough, especially when paired with a little olive oil.",0
"Cornmeal: Cornmeal isnt in the dough, but its used to dust the pizza pan. Cornmeal gives the pizza crust a little extra flavor and crisp. Most delivery pizzas you enjoy have cornmeal on the bottom crust!",0
"Whisk the warm water, yeast, and granulated sugar together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment. Cover and allow to rest for 5 minutes. *If you dont have a stand mixer, simply use a large mixing bowl and mix the dough with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula in the next step.",1
"Add the olive oil, salt, and flour. Beat on low speed for 2 minutes.",1
"Knead the dough: Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 5 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 full minutes. (If youre new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your fingerif it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a windowpane test to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until its thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test.",1
"Rise: Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick sprayjust use the same bowl you used for the dough. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 60-90 minutes or until double in size. (Tip: For the warm environment on a particularly cold day, heat your oven to 150F (66C). Turn the oven off, place the dough inside, and keep the door slightly ajar. This will be a warm environment for your dough to rise. After about 30 minutes, close the oven door to trap the air inside with the rising dough. When its doubled in size, remove from the oven.)",1
"Preheat oven to 475F (246C). Allow it to heat for at least 15-20 minutes as you shape the pizza. (If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well.) Lightly grease baking sheet or pizza pan with nonstick spray or olive oil. Sprinkle lightly with cornmeal, which gives the crust extra crunch and flavor.",1
"Shape the dough: When the dough is ready, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Divide the dough in half. (If not making 2 pizzas, freeze half of the dough for another time. See freezing instructions below.) On a lightly floured work surface using lightly floured hands or rolling pin, gently flatten the dough into a disc. Place on prepared pan and, using lightly floured hands, stretch and flatten the disc into a 12-inch circle, about 1/2-inch thick. If the dough keeps shrinking back as you try to stretch it, stop what youre doing, cover it lightly for 5-10 minutes, then try again. Once shaped into a 12-inch circle, lift the edge of the dough up to create a lip around the edges. I simply pinch the edges up to create the rim. If using a pizza stone, place the dough directly on bakers peels dusted with cornmeal.",1
"Cover dough lightly with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and allow to rest for a few minutes as you prepare your pizza toppings. I suggest pepperoni & green peppers or jalapeo slices, extra cheese pizza, Hawaiian pizza, pesto pizza, spinach artichoke white pizza, or homemade BBQ chicken pizza.",1
"Top & bake the pizza: Using your fingers, push dents into the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. To prevent the filling from making your pizza crust soggy, brush the top lightly with olive oil. Top with your favorite toppings and bake for 13-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown.",1
Slice hot pizza and serve immediately. Cover leftover pizza tightly and store in the refrigerator. Reheat as you prefer. Baked pizza slices can be frozen up to 3 months.,1
"Freezing Instructions: This recipe yields enough dough for two 12-inch pizzas, a little less than 2 pounds total. After the pizza dough rises and you divide the dough in half (step 5), you can freeze one of the balls of dough to make pizza at a later time. Or you can simply freeze both balls of dough separately. Lightly coat all sides of the dough ball(s) with nonstick spray or olive oil. Place the dough ball(s) into individual zipped-top bag(s) and seal tightly, squeezing out all the air. Freeze for up to 3 months. To thaw, place the frozen pizza dough in the refrigerator for about 8 hours or overnight. When ready to make pizza, remove the dough from the refrigerator and allow to rest for 1 hour on the counter. Preheat the oven and continue with step 5, punching down the dough to release air if needed.",1
"Overnight/All Day Instructions: Prepare the dough through step 3, but allow the dough to rise for 8-12 hours in the refrigerator. (If it needs to be in the refrigerator for longer, use cooler water in the dough which will slow the doughs rise and allow for more time.) The slow rise gives the pizza dough wonderful flavor! When ready, continue with step 4. If the dough didnt quite double in size overnight, let it sit at room temperature for 30-45 minutes before punching down (step 5).",1

Yeast: Red Star Platinum yeast is an instant yeast. You can use active dry yeast instead. The rise time will be at least 90 minutes. Reference my Baking with Yeast Guide for answers to common yeast FAQs.,1

"Jen says: May 15, 2024 How long can frozen dough thaw and keep in the refrigerator? I used this dough in my classroom and froze half for a later date. I wanted to make pepperoni rolls on a Monday, but that would mean thawing the dough over the weekend in the refrigerator. Would that be ok? How many days can it rest in the refrigerator? Thank you.Reply Lexi @ Sally's Baking Recipes says: May 15, 2024 Hi Jen, we dont recommend much more than overnight (no more than 24 hours) for thawing the pizza dough.Reply",0

"David Parker says: May 14, 2024 Great recipe, may home made pizzas turned out great, but what can I do about the dough being so sticky when starting to knead? The dough literally sticks to my hand, and I end up adding quite a bit of flour to my hands and work surface. Should I experiment by adding more flour to the original recipe? I use strong Bread flour.Reply Trina @ Sally's Baking Recipes says: May 14, 2024 Hi David! You can add a little more flour if needed.Reply",0

Made it twice and even though the dough rises, it comes out flat and uncooked lookingReply Trina @ Sally's Baking Recipes says: May 10, 2024 Hi Todd, did the dough collapse when baking?

"Cathy Lutz says: May 1, 2024 My pizza story. I am determined. Made the dough. Made the sauce. Shredded the cheese. The first pizza looked promising, but stuck to the peel, even with corn meal, so I folded it up and put it in the pan and spread out the stuff. It wasnt pretty. In the oven it went. While rolling out the second crust, I knocked the Pyrex bowl filled with shredded cheese, to the floor and it shattered. My husband cleaned up the cheese and glass. Then mopped. The first pizza turned out good, tho. Crust was excellent. Hubby is getting more cheese and tomorrow, will use the second crust to make calzones. I struggle in the kitchen. I will try again next week!Reply McKenzie says: May 7, 2024 You got this!Reply",0

"Becks says: April 25, 2024 Stickiest dough Ive ever made, Ill be staying with the bbc pizza dough recipe!Reply Stephanie @ Sally's Baking Recipes says: May 1, 2024 Hi Becks, Thank you for trying this recipe. There are a lot of variables that go into the consistency of dough, even down to the weather and humidity in the air. Theres nothing wrong with adding a little more flour to bring the dough into a less sticky and knead-able consistency if you decide to try this again.Reply",0

 1 3/4 cups plain / all purpose flour,0
" 3/4 cup cocoa powder , unsweetened (Note 2)",0
 1 1/2 tsp baking powder,0
 1 1/2 tsp baking soda (bi-carb soda),0
 2 cups white sugar (Note 1),0
 1 tsp salt,0
 2 eggs (~55-65g / 2 oz each),0
 1 cup milk (low or full fat),0
 1/2 cup vegetable oil (or canola),0
 2 tsp vanilla extract,0
 1 cup boiling water,0
 1 1/2 batches Chocolate Buttercream Frosting (slide scaler on recipe),0
Preheat oven to 180C/350F (160C fan). Read Note 4 regarding shelf positions.,1
"Grease 2 x 22cm/9"" cake pans with butter, then line the base. (Note 3 re: springform pans and other pan sizes).",1
"Sift flour, cocoa, baking powder and baking soda into a large bowl. Add Sugar and salt. Whisk briefly to combine.",1
"Add eggs, milk, oil and vanilla. Whisk well to combine until lump free - about 30 seconds.",1
Add boiling water and whisk to incorporate. The batter is VERY thin (see video).,1
Pour batter into cake pans.,1
Bake for 35 minutes or until a wooden skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. See Note 4 regarding cook time if pans are on different shelves.,1
"Cool for 10 minutes, then turn out onto wire racks upside down (Note 5).",1
Cool completely before frosting. I frosted the cake with my Chocolate Buttercream Frosting (scale recipe up by 50%).,1

"Rebecca says January 28, 2024 at 5:36 pm I use a closed cake tin sometimes (like a bundt tin) which is grease well with butter and then dust with flour. That works. Ive also used a good quality spring-form tin and again, butter and flour the base and sides, then make a paper base as recommended, but I make it larger. Then I cut in the edges so when I lay it it in the base, the sides go up a bit. That also stops the batter flowing out. Or you can make muffins and they wont flow out! For the ganache, make sure you have a thick, high fat cream to start with. The more chocolate to cream ratio the thicker it will be and the and harder it sets. Unless you use low fat cream (and dont!), the whole thing will whip to a thick consistency. Dont add flour. Uncooked flour will will taste wrong and have a pasty, grainy texture. The recipe has great suggestions re ratio of chocolate to cream to get the consistency you want. It is in the notes section! Good luck! It is an awesome recipe!ReplyRachael says January 28, 2024 at 8:49 pm Thanks actually the next day the ganache was awesome and thick!!! Thanks for your tips!Reply",0

"STEP 3Melt the butter in the pan and stir in the flour to make a paste. Cook for a couple of minutes, stirring until the paste turns golden. Add a splash of the milk, then whisk to combine. Continue slowly adding the milk, whisking continuously until you have a smooth, creamy sauce.",1
"STEP 4Crumble the stock cube into the sauce and add 250ml water. Return to a gentle simmer, then return the chicken and veg to the pan. Stir in the mustard and thyme, and season well. Cover with a lid and simmer over a low heat for 15-20 mins, stirring occasionally until the chicken is tender. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 if you're cooking the pie straightaway. Shred the chicken in the pan using two forks, pulling it into bite-sized pieces. Once completely cool, the filling will keep chilled for up to two days (providing the chicken is within its use-by date), or frozen for up to two months.",1
"STEP 5Transfer the filling to a pie dish (or divide between individual pie dishes). Brush a little of the beaten egg around the rim of the dish. Unravel the pastry and lay it over the top of the dish, then trim the edges with kitchen scissors, leaving a little pastry overhanging the edge. Crimp this excess to seal the pieBrush the pastry all over with some more of the beaten egg and poke a few holes in the top using a skewer (this will release any steam inside during baking). Roll out any pastry offcuts and cut out decorations for the top, if you like. Stick these to the pastry and brush with any remaining beaten egg. Bake for 35-40 mins until the pastry is golden brown and the filling is bubbling at the edge.",1

Shaizin05.19.2024My brownies did not turn out good cause of the granulated sugar used in it. Like can we just use powdered sugar instead of granulated sugar? And my brownies became rock hard Reply ,0
Alanna05.19.2024These did not turn out for me  I was suspicious of the incredibly long cook time so decided to check them at 30 mins and they were over cooked. I would typically expect something around the 22 minute mark for this kind of recipe and should have gone with my instinct!Reply ,0

"2 eggs + water  Michelle uses a bit of water with the eggs to achieve the moist, gooey texture of boxed mix brownies without any commercial emulsifiers. And because this recipe doesnt contain any baking powder, eggs are essential for helping the brownies puff up in the oven.",0
"Powdered sugar  The trick to making homemade brownies that are just like ones from a box! Powdered sugar contains cornstarch, which helps thicken the batter without the chemical additives youd find in a mix.",0
Unsweetened cocoa powder  Michelle recommends using Hersheys Special Dark Dutch-processed cocoa powder (I used Whole Foods 365 Cocoa Powder). Make sure to sift it if its lumpy!,0
"Oil  While many recipes for brownies use unsalted butter, Michelles calls for canola oil, just like the boxed mix. I use olive oil because its what I keep on hand, and I love the rich flavor.",0
Vanilla Extract  1/2 teaspoon vanilla really amps up the chocolate flavor.,0
"Better chocolate chips = better brownies. In her book, Michelle writes that one of the biggest secrets to making great brownies is using large, good-quality chocolate chips. She recommends Ghiradellis 60% Cacao Bittersweet Baking Chips, while I love Enjoy Lifes Dark Chocolate Morsels. Either brand would fantastic in this recipe!",0
"Its better to pull them out too early than to leave them in too long. No one likes dry brownies, so err on the side of caution when youre making this recipe. Bake them until a toothpick inserted comes out with just a few crumbs attached. If youre on the fence, go ahead and take them out of the oven. Theyll continue to firm up as they cool!",0
"Wait for them to cool. Try your best to resist eating these guys straight out of the oven. Letting them cool makes them gooier and fudgier, and theyll be less likely to crumble when you slice them. Plus, theyll have an even richer chocolate flavor. Trust me, its worth the wait!",0

8x8 Baking Dish (this is the one I use so they don't overcook),0
Cooking Spray (I love this avocado oil one from Chosen Foods),0
Parchment Paper (this makes it so much easier to remove the brownies from the pan),0
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar*,0
3/4 cup all-purpose flour,0
"2/3 cup cocoa powder, sifted if lumpy",0
"1/2 cup powdered sugar, sifted if lumpy",0
1/2 cup dark chocolate chips,0
3/4 teaspoons sea salt,0
2 large eggs,0
1/2 cup canola oil or extra-virgin olive oil**,0
2 tablespoons water,0
1/2 teaspoon vanilla,0
Preheat the oven to 325F. Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish (not a 9x9 dish or your brownies will overcook) with cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper.,1
"In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.",1
"In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla.",1
Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.,1
"Pour the batter into the prepared pan (it'll be thick - that's ok) and use a spatula to smooth the top. Bake for 40 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached (note: it's better to pull the brownies out early than to leave them in too long). Cool completely before slicing.*** Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. These also freeze well!",1
"nice human05.18.2024shut up, you trollReply ",0
"Phoebe Moore (L&L Recipe Developer)05.17.2024Hi Kerri, yep, you can! The batter is very thick, so I would mix them with the dry ingredients before combining the dry and wet. Another option is to press nuts into the tops of the brownies before baking. Hope you enjoy!Reply ",0

"Anna 5 days ago We made an Indian feast for our family yesterday (some vegan, some vegetarian, some omnivore) and we just have to say thank you thank you thank you for all your amazing recipes! We spend 5,5 hours in the kitchen and made this tofu tikka masala, chana masala, saag aloo and naan and it was mindblowing how delicious all of the dishes were. The effort was definitely worth it and the smell in the kitchen was unreal  Everyone loved it and were planning another big Indian food evening again soon. Sending a big thank you for all your hard work from Berlin, Germany :)Reply",0
"Bhavini Haria 2 weeks ago I absolutely love this recipe thank you so much! Its such a great option for the whole family, I put hardly any chilli to make it suitable for my 3 year old to eat and she loves it!Ive also done half cauliflower and half tofu, this also works really well for the texture.Thank you for sharing Reply",0

"Ashleigh 3 weeks ago I decided to make this for dinner tonight and, oh my lanta, it was DELICIOUSLY INCREDIBLE! As a beginner home cook, the recipe was easy to follow and sub-out as needed and the end result is restaurant quality! Wont catch me getting take-out now that Ive made this!Reply",0
"Kaitlin @ Rainbow Plant Life 3 weeks ago Your review made our day, Ashleigh! Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts and for trying out the recipe.Reply",0
"Janet 3 weeks ago Love the mix of flavors.dont like the texture of the tofu. I havent worked much with tofu and thought that pressing and marinating it would somehow make it more meaty but it still had that soft texture that gives me the willies. But again the flavor, with all those spices, is heavenly.Reply",0
"Kaitlin @ Rainbow Plant Life 3 weeks ago Hi Janet, glad you enjoyed the flavors but sorry to hear you werent a fan of the texture of the tofu. Did you use extra firm tofu? It shouldnt have been very soft. I use a tofu press at home to help get a lot of the extra liquid out.Reply",0
"Shay 4 weeks ago Despite a few mistakes along the way, this turned out delicious and I now intend to get it to perfection. Thank you!Reply",0
Martha 4 weeks ago There are lots of ingredients and lots of steps to making this dish but it is SO worth it. I love the planning and shopping process when I KNOW Im making something so delicious. Take Nishas advice and make the masala sauce in advance.Reply,0

"Gourmet restaurant-quality: If youve ever cooked Indian food at home and felt disappointed that it didnt taste as good as the restaurant stuff, this recipe will deliver that experience. Actually, Max (and I) think its better than any comparable meal weve eaten at an Indian restaurant.",0
"Perfectly balanced: This tofu tikka masala is a party in your mouth but theres no single flavor that stands out. Instead, its a pure harmony of flavors: tangy, spicy, slightly smoky, citrusy, and buttery.",0
"Authentic Indian flavors: While tofu tikka masala is not an authentic Indian dish, the cooking techniques and flavor layering here give this dish authentic Indian flavors, the kind youd expect from a really good Indian restaurant or an Indian aunties house.",0
"Indulgent but wholesome: this plant-based spin on chicken tikka masala is vegan, gluten-free, and nut-free (it does contain coconut) but is simultaneously indulgent and oh-so-creamy.",0

"For the whole green cardamom, split open the pods and use only the black seeds inside (discard the pods).",0
"Kasoori methi, AKA fenugreek leaves, adds a bold, savory flavor to the marinade and the masala that cant be replicated with anything else. Ive listed it as optional, but if you visit an Indian grocery store, Id consider it a must-buy!",0
"An electric spice grinder makes this a breeze (this one grinds everything super finely; affiliate link). If you are using a mortar and pestle, itll take more time and be a bit more difficult; also be sure break the cinnamon sticks into a few pieces (before or after toasting) to make it easier to grind.",0
Dal Makhani: an incredibly creamy and complex dal thats perfect for special occasions.,0

 1 tablespoon vegan butter,0
" 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice, plus more to taste",0
" 3 cups cooked white rice or flatbread, such as naan or roti",0
" Vegan yogurt to dollop on top (optional, but adds a nice cooling balance)",0
"Prepare the tofu. Use a tofu press. Or, wrap the tofu in a clean dish towel or several layers of paper towels, weigh it down with a heavy cookbook or a large plate weighed down by a few cans of beans. Press the tofu for 20 to 30 minutes. Tear the tofu into chunks with your hands and transfer the tofu chunks to a large bowl.NOTE: the tofu chunks shouldnt be too large or too small (see photos in blog post for reference), but its totally fine if theyre not all the same size.",1
"Make the tikka spice blend. Heat a small or medium frying pan over medium heat. Once warm, add the whole spices (cumin and coriander seeds, cloves, peppercorns, cardamom seeds, cinnamon sticks, and fenugreek leaves). Toast, shaking the pan frequently, until they are very fragrant and toasty, and the lighter seeds have browned, 2  to 3  minutes. Transfer the seeds out of the pan and allow to cool. Once cool, add to a spice grinder or a mortar & pestle and crush until finely ground. Pour into a bowl, add the ground spices (Indian red chile powder, turmeric, paprika, nutmeg, and ginger), and toss all the spices to combine.",1
"Make the Tikka marinade. In a medium bowl, mix together the spice blend with the yogurt, garlic, ginger, lemon juice, oil, and salt. Pour the marinade over the tofu chunks and use your hands to very gently coat all the crevices of the tofu, taking care to not mash it. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours, or up to 8 hours.",1
"When ready to bake the tofu, arrange an oven rack 6 inches from the heat source (usually, the second rack). Add a 12-inch cast iron skillet to the rack and preheat the oven to 500F/260C. Once the skillet is smoking hot, transfer it to the stove or a pot holder. Turn the broiler to high.",1
"Add enough oil to lightly coat the bottom of the pan. Add the marinated tofu to the pan, leaving excess marinade behind. It will be pretty tightly packed into the pan.Return the pan to the second oven rack and broil until the tofu is cooked through and charred in some spots on top, 10 to 12 minutes. NOTE: after the 5-minute mark, I recommend checking every 1-2 minutes to prevent burning since every oven is different.",1
"MAKE THE MASALA. Heat the 3 tablespoons of oil in a deep 12-inch saut pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the cumin seeds and cook for 1 minute, swirling the pan frequently. Add the dried chilies and cook for another 30 seconds, swirling frequently to prevent burning.",1
"Add the onions with a couple pinches of salt and cook until golden brown, about 6 to 8 minutes (if the onions start browning too quickly, lower the heat to medium).",1
"Add in a few splashes of water to stop the onions from browning too much, then add the garlic, ginger, diced serrano pepper, and turmeric, and cook for 1 minute, tossing frequently. Add the red chili powder, coriander, and tomato paste. Stir frequently for 30 to 60 seconds.",1
"Add the tomatoes and their juices, and cook until broken down and softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the cilantro stems (save the leaves for the garnish), 3 tablespoons of water, and 1  teaspoons kosher salt, and stir. Cover the pan and bring to a simmer.",1
"Simmer the masala for 15 minutes, opening the pot to stir occasionally, until the liquid has mostly evaporated. Scoop out the dried red chilies and discard.",1
"Add in the coconut milk, garam masala, and vegan butter. Crush the fenugreek leaves in your hand to release the aroma and add to the masala. Increase the heat slightly and stir until everything is combined and the butter is melted.If you prefer a smoother texture, feel free to run an immersion blender through the masala.",1
"Add the baked tofu, the thinly sliced serrano pepper (if using for spicy spicy!), and lemon juice. Simmer for 2 minutes and coat the tofu in the sauce. Taste, and if its a bit too acidic, add a tiny bit of sugar ( to  teaspoon).",1
Garnish the masala with the cilantro leaves and season to taste with salt. Serve tofu tikka masala over rice and/or with Indian flatbread.,1

"mart says11 July 2020 at 9:52 amI have agree with Len, Im a Master Chef & lecturer. Its always best to rest pastry, give the gluten time to re-bind. Though I have to add. If you crumb the butter and lard with flour then add boiling water your get a better paste. Melting the butter and fat, doesnt get it hot enough and you get fat separation, which make your cooked pastry dark and patchy.Reply Jane Sarchet says1 December 2020 at 11:19 amThanks for the feedback Mart!

"MaryLou says6 August 2020 at 11:58 pmOMGosh! Im going to try that.Gosh i was faffing about but my pies are going to my BAKEDAY group today! Fingers crossed. I used my own chicken stock from the freezer with gelatine. I did mine in mini spring form tins (not high enough really for that traditional look) and released them half way and continued baking. Also i got weeping from the fillingwhich made attaching the lids tricky. Armed with reading the tips too late, ill assemble the filling at the last minute. Thanks from Hobart Tasmania Our little Islans State has borders closed to everyone and no covid for 2 months now so we have normal activities but maintaining distancing, antibacterial hand wash everwhere and of course hand washing.

"Jane Sarchet says3 September 2019 at 7:40 amHi Janet, what a fabulous tradition for your family! They are very lucky as theres a lot of work involved for you, especially if you dont eat them yourself!Jane xReply",0

"Jane Sarchet says1 December 2020 at 9:07 pmHey Rebecca, thats sweet of you! Honestly, Ive never made it with gelatine. By following the instructions on the pack you should get it to set, but you may be missing out on some of the savoury flavour that you get from using a pigs trotter. Jane xReply",0
Jane Sarchet says28 December 2019 at 1:07 pmAbsolutely! I popped the papers back on for the photos for that very reason! Janie xReply,0
"Jane Sarchet says28 December 2019 at 12:42 pmHi Cheryl! Theres nothing to stop you eating them hot, even with the amount of jelly stated in the recipe, however they are traditionally made to eat cold so that the jelly sets and the pastry becomes even more delicious. If you give them a go, and try them hot, please do let me know what you think! Janie xReply",0
"Jane Sarchet says27 January 2020 at 4:27 pmHey Mike, thanks for the message. And great question! Ive never seen pork pies frozen in stores or butchers, and Ive never tried freezing them either. They would certainly be edible after defrosting and wouldnt make you sick, but Im wondering if the pastry would lose some of its texture and/or taste? Honestly, Im not sure of the answer. But if you give it a go would you report back and let us know how you got on? Many thanks & I hope you enjoy making them. Theyre a labour of love but well worth the effort :) Janie xReply",0
"Stephen says25 August 2020 at 10:49 amMike, Our local butcher freezes them and while they are edible when thawed, one should really question the reasoning behind it. Get yourself a group of makers and spread around the love, reduce the work load and pick up tips.Reply",0

"Jane Sarchet says1 December 2020 at 12:52 pmHey Lisa, yes you can! Wrap tightly in cling film/plastic wrap, or foil. I would be tempted to do 2 layers just to make sure they are well protected. Freeze soon after cooling thoroughly, and eat within 2-3 months to prevent freezer burn. Jane xReply",0

"Jane Sarchet says1 December 2020 at 9:03 pmHey Luke, yes the recipe makes 3 of the pork pies shown in the picture. I imagine the pork pies will be fine on a warm day, I dont suspect the jelly would turn to liquid again as its very firm. That said, and due to the risk of food poisoning from pork products that arent kept refrigerated, I would absolutely advise that you store it in a coolbag or box. Jane xReply",0

Preheat the oven to 180C (350F) Gas mark 4,1
"Sieve the flour into a large, ovenproof mixing bowl and pop in the oven to warm.You're not trying to cook the flour, just warm it and the bowl through, so reduce the heat as necessary if you don't get to work on the pastry straight away.",1
"Place the water and lard into a saucepan.Gently bring to a boil and when the lard has melted, pour into the flour and salt mixture.",1
"Stir with a wooden spoon until well combined.Working quickly, knead the dough when it is cool enough to handle.It will feel just lovely!",1
Place on a floured board and cut off 1/3 of the dough.Replace this into the mixing bowl with a tea towel over the top to keep the heat in. This off-cut will be the 'lid' to your pies.,1
"With the remaining 2/3 you are going to make the 'body' of your pie.If you are making one large pie, keep it as is. However if you are making smaller pies like I have in the pictures, divide the pastry into as many pies as you are making.",1
"Work on one portion of dough at a time, keeping the rest in the warm bowl.",1
"I use pigs trotters for my savoury pork pie jelly, but you can also use gelatin sheets if you prefer.",1
"Place the cleaned trotter into the slow cooker along with the water, onion, salt and white pepper.Cook on high for 4 hours, or on low overnight.",1
I like to split the trotter halfway through the cooking time to allow more of the gelatin to be released into the cooking water.,1
"Once cooked, drain well, keeping all of that wonderful stock.The debris can be disposed of and any extra stock can be frozen in ice cube trays and used in soups, stews and casseroles to enrich and boost nutrition.",1
"Dust a Pork Pie Dolly or an upturned glass with flour, then mould the warm pastry into an even layer with your hands. There should be a small overhang to seal the lid on, and you dont want any gaps or splits.",1
"Repeat with the remaining dough.Carefully remove the pastry from the glass, and tie a strip of folded baking paper around the 'belly' of the pie to help hold it up.",1
"Mix together the pork, sage, salt & pepper. Carefully fill each pie with 1/3 of the mixture, pressing down as necessary and leaving the meat in a dome shape in the middle.",1
"Divide the lid pastry into as many pies as you are making, and roll each piece out into a circle.",1
"Brush the overhang area with the beaten egg, and place the lids on.",1
"Now seal the edges of the lids and body pastry together. You can simply press the pastry together firmly, or crimp it as in the pictures.",1
"Using the tip of a sharp knife, pierce a hole in the pastry and twist the knife to make the hole round & a little larger.This is where you will pour in your stock once baked, so the hole needs to be big enough to fit your funnel tip.",1
"Brush the pies generously all over with egg wash. The more egg used, the shinier the pies will be.",1
"Bake the pies in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Then reduce the oven to 160, and continue cooking for a further 50 minutes.",1
"Halfway through the cooking time, take out of the oven, remove the baking paper sleeves if using, and brush again all over with egg wash.Return to the oven to finish cooking.",1
It is essential that pork reaches a minimum of 65C (150F) to be safe to consume. Feel free to test the centre temperature with a digital thermometer if you have one.,1
"Set the cooked pies to cool on the kitchen counter.When at room temperature, move to the fridge to let cool fully.",1
Take your cold pies and gently insert the tip of the funnel into the hole in the lid.,1
Pour your hot stock into the hole slowly.You don't want it to overflow so allow it time to soak down into all the gaps and crevices.,1
"When the pies are full of stock, return them to the fridge to fully cool again.Do not cut into them until the stock has had plenty of time to solidify, preferably overnight.",1
"When ready to eat, cut the pie into wedges to see your work of art, and enjoy!",1

"Len Cawthraw says22 August 2019 at 9:37 am Hi Jamie. An amazing looking pork or as we call them in Yorkshire a Growler. I have been making pork pies from a family recipe for more than 25 years and I am so pleased to see the art of Pork Pies at home given a boost. Can I pass on a little tip about hot water paste? Make it the day before and then chill overnight in the fridge. Remove from the fridge 2 or 3 hours before you intend to use it to get to room temperature and I promise it is the most manageable pastry you will have ever used. Try it once and you will always make hot water paste this way. Best wishes, LenReply Jane Sarchet says3 September 2019 at 7:42 amOh thats really interesting, I assumed it needed to still be warm to work. Im going to have them another go now using your tip  thank you so much!Jane xReply mart says11 July 2020 at 9:52 amI have agree with Len, Im a Master Chef & lecturer. Its always best to rest pastry, give the gluten time to re-bind. Though I have to add. If you crumb the butter and lard with flour then add boiling water your get a better paste. Melting the butter and fat, doesnt get it hot enough and you get fat separation, which make your cooked pastry dark and patchy.Reply Jane Sarchet says1 December 2020 at 11:19 amThanks for the feedback Mart! Jane x MaryLou says6 August 2020 at 11:58 pmOMGosh! Im going to try that.Gosh i was faffing about but my pies are going to my BAKEDAY group today! Fingers crossed.

"Jacqueline says10 November 2019 at 4:23 pmHi Jane, This looks like a wonderful recipe. I am going to make them for my boyfriend who is English. I do have one question though. For the baking sheet wrappers, you say in the recipe to take them off, however, in some of your pictures, it looks like that you left them on. I would like to leave them on if it will work as it just adds to the homemade look of the dish and would look great on the sideboard having some still wrapped and some cut in half. Is it still okay to leave them on? Thank you again for sharing! :<)Reply Jane Sarchet says28 December 2019 at 1:07 pmAbsolutely! I popped the papers back on for the photos for that very reason!

Theres nothing to stop you eating them hot, even with the amount of jelly stated in the recipe, however they are traditionally made to eat cold so that the jelly sets and the pastry becomes even more delicious.

They would certainly be edible after defrosting and wouldnt make you sick, but Im wondering if the pastry would lose some of its texture and/or taste? Honestly, Im not sure of the answer. But if you give it a go would you report back and let us know how you got on? Many thanks & I hope you enjoy making them. Theyre a labour of love but well worth the effort :) Janie xReply Stephen says25 August 2020 at 10:49 amMike, Our local butcher freezes them and while they are edible when thawed, one should really question the reasoning behind it. Get yourself a group of makers and spread around the love, reduce the work load and pick up tips.Reply",0

"Pepe Simn says1 April 2020 at 9:58 amHi, Jane!Thank you for this fantastic recipe. Ive always loved pork pie and I havent managed to enjoy one in years. Now that we are all cloistered because of this damned coronavirus I have decided to look for some traditional British recipes and put them into practice here in Spain. A few days ago the challenge was chicken and mushroom pie; yesterday it was the turn of humble pork pie. I documented myself by exploring several dozen recipes on the net and eventually I decided on yours, which seemed perfectly explained and quite straightforward to me. I put it into practice and the result has been simply amazing. Best pie Ive ever enjoyed! Pity I cannot attach some pics and a bit of the scentThanks a billion, Jane. Your page looks gorgeous, explanations are crystal clear and (last but not least) the ingredients are universal (I could even find them at my small hamlets grocers). After enjoying a second pie (first was for breakfast ha-ha) with peas and a good pint (reminiscences of good old days) I will sit back at my desk to further scrutinise your site; no doubt i will find more authentic traditional recipes to help me get through the confinement.Best wishes from SpainPS If you feel like trying some traditional Spanish recipes in turn, just let me know. I feel deeply in debt.Reply Jane Sarchet says1 December 2020 at 11:57 amPepe, what a wonderful message! Im so delighted that you enjoyed the recipe, it really is a cracker isnt it?! Jane xReply",0

"dendo says5 April 2020 at 7:44 am perfect confinement recipe! clear instructions, helpful (and tasteful) photos, and the right encouraging tone. and just the thing to polish off a remaining branston pickle jar. a few mods, though: -if making a big pie, puff pastry works quite well too. when left to cool, it denses down and gets quite moist. -for those squicked out by jelly, it is possible to replace it with a tasty gravy (e.g. red onion) blenderised to get it creamy, and starched with maizena. as it cools down it will also set, without that wobbly taste sensation. im serving the cold pie with piping hot mash, for the temperature clash. thanks for providing the recipe, keep up the good work!Reply Jane Sarchet says1 December 2020 at 11:46 amThanks for your lovely message Dendo, and my new favourite expression is now squicked out :) Jane xReply",0

"Luke says13 July 2020 at 12:53 pmHi, I am very excited to try these! Just two quick questions: Does the recipe make 3 pies of the size shown in the picture? Also I am making them for a picnic and it will likely be a warm day, do you think the jelly will become runny? (Perhaps I should add a touch of gelatin to keep it set?)Reply Jane Sarchet says1 December 2020 at 9:03 pmHey Luke, yes the recipe makes 3 of the pork pies shown in the picture. I imagine the pork pies will be fine on a warm day, I dont suspect the jelly would turn to liquid again as its very firm. That said, and due to the risk of food poisoning from pork products that arent kept refrigerated, I would absolutely advise that you store it in a coolbag or box. Jane xReply",0

This lovely recipe will be added to the table this year for sure. I have tried it once so far, the taste was outstanding, my husband loved it. I must admit I struggled a bit with the pastry, bit fiddly for me but I will persevere for my next attempt, it is worth it.

"Derek says28 December 2020 at 3:15 pmI used to work in Chesterfield in an office near a pork butcher. His pork pies were famous and delicious beyond description. Once we persuaded him to sell a pie which was just out of the oven. We ate it hot and it was simply sublime. I have made pies almost every Christmas since and occasionally eaten one hot. Lovely. This Christmas we were given a couple of pies made by Henry Walker of Melton Mowbray. One, we ate cold as usual and one we wrapped and put in the freezer. I have long been tempted to heat up a store bought pork pie and decided one of these would be reheated. I baked it at 180 C for 40 minutes and I will re-bake again. We ate it with mushy peas. It was the best thing I ate this year, never mind this Christmas.Reply Jane Sarchet says30 December 2020 at 12:03 pmWOW!!! Thanks Derek, this is high praise indeed for eating them hot! I shall certainly bear it in mind next batch I make :) Merry Christmas and heres hoping your 2021 is magical Jane xReply",0

A couple of hours on the medium-low flame is plenty and you wont need to cut the trotters in half, theyll just fall apart naturally. You might want to give it half an hour with the lid off to reduce but just play it by ear, if its already lost some liquid. Im on my fourth batch this month and am just making jelly as Ive run out. I pour my jelly into ice cube bags and freeze it so that I have some to hand when I get the urge.Reply",0

"Start by curing the belly: In a small bowl, combine the pepper, sugar, paprika, salt & curing salt. Place belly on a foil lined tray and pat dry with paper towels. Using half of the cure mix, sprinkle evenly over the surface of the belly, and rub in gently. Turn over and repeat on other side with remaining mix. Place the entire belly and curing mix into a large zip top bag and place in refrigerator for 7 days. Each day the belly should be flipped onto the other side, and the contents (which will transform to a liquid) should be massaged around.",1
"After 7 days, remove from the bag and rinse under water. Pat dry with paper towels, and place back in fridge uncovered (on a rack over a pan to catch any drips) for 24 hours.",1

"Dianne Hadorn October 10, 2021 at 1:04 pm This sounds delicious and simple, but I have a question. We have just had our first pastured hog processed at the butcher and I did have the belly sliced. (First time with a cut sheet)Of course, when we pick it up, the bacon is frozen into 1lb sliced packets. I tried frying it using only salt, pepper, etc, but NOT tasty at all. My question  how do I cure, smoke, use this recipe since it is already sliced and in 1lb packages? Thanks so much Reply Jess Pryles October 18, 2021 at 12:50 pm Unfortunately its not possible to cure and smoke once already sliced. Next hog! Reply Andrew Elkins December 29, 2022 at 1:33 am So I used This recipe a while back and used the 3lbs of belly. I found It was a touch salty but other than that a great recipe, I just used It again and made 10lbs of belly. I cut the salt back to 6tbsp for that 10lbs and it came out perfectly salty. Love you recipes keep up the good work! Reply Edd December 24, 2021 at 11:56 pm Sounds a lot like the uncured smoked jowl I get at an international grocery. I fry it with a good bit of black pepper ground over it. I avoid salty foods like bacon and I enjoy it. But its not bacon. Reply Kimball December 5, 2022 at 12:40 am I did the same thing and have a bunch of packages of Fresh Pork Side. We just found a recipe that really makes it tasty, 2 TBS brown Sugar, 1 Tsp salt, 1/8-1/4 tsp pepper. Mix it up and use a shaker to dust the strips in a foil lined baking sheet. Cook 20 minutes @ 350 F, then flip, dust again with shaker mixture and finish cooking another 10-20 mins depending on thickness of slices until desired crispness is achieved. Reply",0

And I can not believe how amazing the Bacon is. So much better than any Bacon Ive ever had. cooked some of course the first day. and this morning bacon and Eggs!! Thank you for sharing this recipe. if you have any doubts I suggest you put them aside and try this recipe!!! I would give it 10 stars.

"Dan November 6, 2021 at 2:58 pm We were looking for a recipe to make back bacon, something we have had in England, Cornwall, and Scotland, that we cannot find here. I chose this recipe and was very impressed. We use a pork loin rather than belly, and is very close to what we had in the UK. After curing and smoking, we sliced the back bacon, and vacuum sealed packages of 4 slices each and froze them. We now back bacon whenever we want, for a price comparable to what we would pay for regular store bought bacon. Reply",0

I went 5 days on the brine, set in fridge for 24 hrs then to the smoker, vs the wet brine which took min of 8-14 days brining, 24 hr set up in fridge then to the smoker so it dry brine and this recipe with the Apple spice brown sugar add !

"Tx Tom April 12, 2022 at 3:30 am So I bought a pork belly at Costco, cut it in half and used half to make a smoked pork belly on my Vision kamado smoker. I always wanted to try making my own bacon and found Jess Payless site. Followed the recipe exactly though I had to double it given the size of the belly I had. Used my electric smoker to maintain the exact temp needed and added a smoker tube for extra smoke filled with a 50/50 mix of hardwood pellets and cherry wood chips. Refilled the tube after about 5 hours with only cherry chips. I mug cherry chips in the normal smoking port a few times, but I dont think it was really necessary.Took about 10 hours to get to the 150 degrees needed. (Okay, I admit I had 155 deg in my head so it actually got to 153 before I realized my mistake). Had about 8 hours of continuous extra smoke. I stuck it in the refrigerator last night and sliced some for dinner after work today. THE BEST bacon I ever tasted! Not really that difficult to make and well worth waiting for.

"Whisk espresso and Grand Marnier. Grand Marnier makes this a boozier tiramisu because there is alcohol in both the coffee mixture and the mascarpone cream. Grand Marniers flavor is great in this dessert, but you can skip it if desired. If you dont have espresso, purchase espresso powder and follow the measurements in the recipe Notes.",1
"Dip half of the ladyfingers in the espresso mixture. Ladyfingers soak up a lot of liquid within 1 second, so make it a very quick dunk. You dont want them overly saturated and soggy, because as the tiramisu chills, theyll soften up underneath all the cream.",1
"Line dipped ladyfingers in bottom of pan. If needed, cut some ladyfingers to fill in any empty spaces.",1
Beat mascarpone and rum together. Use quality mascarpone. I like BelGioioso brand (not sponsoredtruly what I always use).,1
"Gently cook egg yolks and sugar. Egg yolks are a main ingredient in tiramisu. Use a double boiler or makeshift bowl/saucepan double boiler to cook egg yolks and sugar together. Maidas recipe also uses the egg whites, which come soon after this step.",1
Beat egg yolks into mascarpone cream mixture.,1
Whip heavy cream and vanilla extract into medium peaks.,1
Fold whipped cream into mascarpone cream mixture.,1
"Beat the egg whites and salt together until foamy, then slowly pour in sugar and beat until stiff peaks form.",1
Fold egg white mixture into mascarpone cream mixture.,1
Layer half of the cream mixture on top of the ladyfingers. An offset spatula helps.,1
Dip and layer remaining ladyfingers.,1
"Top with remaining cream mixture, then chill for for 23 hours.",1
"Dust with cocoa. After chilling for a couple hours, dust the top layer with a dense layer of unsweetened cocoa powder. Use a sifter. This is a classic finishing touch to the entire tiramisu dessert.",1

"Egg whites or whipped cream? Most tiramisu recipes use whipped egg whites OR whipped cream in the mascarpone cream layers. Egg whites contribute a more airy texture, while whipped cream makes the filling a bit more rich. This recipe actually uses both, so youre getting both delightful textures.",0
"Are the eggs cooked? Tiramisu is a no-bake dessert. The egg yolks are gently cooked on the stovetop, but the egg whites are raw. Purchase pasteurized eggs because they are safe to consume raw. If you cant find pasteurized eggs, you can omit the egg whites entirely. See the recipe Notes for instructions.",0
What size pan to use? This particular tiramisu recipe yields a large volume and the pan will be very full. Make sure your pan is large enough. I recommend a 913-inch dish with at least a 1214-cup capacity. This 4-quart dish is wonderful too.,0
You need a large 913-inch baking pan/dish with at least a 12-14 cup capacity. Set aside and have ready to go!,1
"Dip half of the ladyfingers: You will form 2 layers each of dipped ladyfingers and mascarpone cream. Lets begin with the 1st layer of ladyfingers. Whisk the espresso and Grand Marnier together in a shallow bowl. One at a time, quickly dip each side of the ladyfinger into the espresso mixture. You dont want to over-saturate the ladyfinger with liquid because then the ladyfingers will taste soggy. Just a quick dip on each side. Arrange the dipped ladyfingers in the baking pan to make one solid layer. If needed, cut some ladyfingers to fill in any empty spaces. Reserve remaining espresso mixture and ladyfingers for another layer.",1
"Begin the mascarpone cream: With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the mascarpone and rum together on medium speed in a large bowl for a few seconds, just to combine. Do not overmix. Set aside.",1
"Prepare a double boiler for the egg yolks: If you have a double boiler, use it in this step. If you dont, place a heatproof bowl over a small pot of simmering water over medium-low heat. Dont let the water touch the bottom of the bowl. Using a whisk or eggbeater (I simply use a whisk), whisk the egg yolks and 1/4 cup (50g) of granulated sugar together until light and foamy, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and immediately pour into the mascarpone mixture. Beat on medium speed until combined.",1
"Whip the heavy cream: With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the heavy cream and vanilla extract together on medium-high speed until medium peaks form, about 3 minutes. Medium peaks are between soft/loose peaks and stiff peaks and are the perfect consistency for the tiramisu cream. Fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture.",1
"Beat the egg whites: With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a *clean* whisk attachment, beat the egg whites and salt together on medium-high speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase to high speed and slowly pour in the remaining 1/4 cup (50g) of sugar. Beat until stiff peaks form, about 4-5 minutes. (Do not over-beat as the egg whites will become dry.) Fold into the mascarpone cream.",1
Spread half of the mascarpone cream evenly over bottom layer of ladyfingers. An offset spatula helps spread it neatly and evenly.,1
"Dip remaining ladyfingers: Dip remaining ladyfingers into remaining espresso mixture and arrange one-by-one on top of the mascarpone layer. Gently press each down so they are nice and compact. Using an offset spatula, spread remaining mascarpone mixture evenly on top. If youre using a large enough pan, it should all fit (but it will definitely tower high!). Refrigerate uncovered for 2-3 hours.",1
"Add cocoa layer, then chill: After a couple hours in the refrigerator, sift or strain a dense layer of cocoa powder all over the top. Wipe the rim of the baking dish. Cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, then refrigerate for at least 8-9 more hours and up to 1 day.",1
"Using a sharp knife, slice chilled tiramisu into servings. Wipe knife clean between cuts. A small metal serving spatula is helpful for removing the slices.",1
Cover leftover tiramisu and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.,1
"Freezing Instructions: Prepare tiramisu through step 8. Tightly cover and freeze for up to 3 months. Remove from the freezer, evenly dust the top with cocoa, then thaw in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours. (Can thaw covered or uncovered.)",1
Special Tools (affiliate links): 913-inch Baking Pan | Electric Mixer (Handheld or Stand) | Egg Separator | Double Boiler | Offset Spatula | Fine Mesh Sieve | Small Metal Serving Spatula,1
Smaller Recipe: Halve this recipe for a 9-inch or 10-inch square baking pan.,1
"Espresso: For the espresso, combine 4 Tablespoons instant espresso powder with 1 cups hot water. This is stronger than brewed espresso and perfect for tiramisu. In a pinch, use super-super-strong black coffee.",1
"Grand Marnier: This addition makes this a boozier version of tiramisu because you have alcohol in both the coffee soak mixture and the mascarpone cream. Grand Marniers flavor is lovely in this dessert, but you can skip it and stick with just the dark rum.",1
"Ladyfingers: Ladyfingers (savoiardi in Italian) are a sweet, pretty dry, and finger-shaped sponge cookie/cake. Theyre found in most large grocery stores, Italian markets, or you can purchase them online. You can also make them from scratchthere are many recipes online! I use 2 standard packages of ladyfingers for this recipe.",1
"Eggs: The egg yolks are gently cooked in this recipe, but if youre concerned with eating raw egg whites, purchase pasteurized eggs because they are safe to consume raw. If you cant find pasteurized eggs, you can omit the egg whites entirely. Skip step 6; and in step 4, cook the egg yolks with 1/2 cup sugar and 1/8 teaspoon salt.",1
Non-Alcoholic Version: Omit the Grand Marnier and replace the rum with milk.,1
"Sama Alzyadi says: May 30, 2024 I loved it , I made it Alcohol free and it was fantastic. Definitely will make it again. Its super easy to make.Reply",0
"Kelly Reynolds says: May 29, 2024 This was super delicious and light, very creamy . I made this as the alternate recipe for #SallysbakingchallengeSeemed like a lot of steps but it was actually quite simple to makeReply",0
"Becky Karim says: May 28, 2024 Okay so the first layer of cookies I dipped them in coffee.. but they got so soggy! So I scraped that layer and started over. This time I brushed on the coffee with a kitchen brush.. however then the cookies didnt get enough liquid! So I definitely want to try this recipe again because the flavors were amazing! I let it sit in the fridge overnight and that softened the cookies enough to a cake texture.Reply",0
"Jdn says: May 28, 2024 This is a fantastic recipe! Creamy but light at the same time.I couldnt find pasteurized eggs anywhere, and I was making this for my pregnant friend so I couldnt use the raw egg whites (or the alcohol) so I bought a carton of egg whites and used those. It took a while and I had to add some cream of tartar, but the foamed up beautifully.Will definitely be making this again.Reply",0

"Kara Rohan says: May 20, 2024 This was my first time making tiramisu, so at first I felt a bit intimidated by the recipe. Having said that, the instructions were very clear, and the video was especially helpful. The final result was awesome. I halved the recipe, and even then, the flavors were on point and the texture of the creamy layers were so smooth and fluffy. The espresso-Grand Marnier mixture was also nice when soaked up by the ladyfingers.Reply",0
"Katriona Brownlow says: May 18, 2024 Made this for the May Challenge! Definitely a lot of steps.

Thanks again Sally for another winner recipe!Reply",0
"Don Starr says: May 18, 2024 Made this for a dinner party. EVERYONE LOVED IT!!! Flavors were wonderful and the filling texture was so creamy and light. Perfect version! Even 3 days later, the leftover piece that I saved was still really good!! Will make it again for sure!!Reply",0
"Sarah says: May 17, 2024 I had never tried this well-known dessert before so I was excited to try it. The coffee flavour was a bit much for me and I didnt like the texture of the lady fingers, but I really enjoyed the creamy layers!!Reply",0
